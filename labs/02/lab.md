# Assignment #1:

Write a script to ask current user for his/her `birth year`, then ask for the
`current year`. Validate that the birth year is less than the current year, and
print out the current user's age. Print an error `otherwise`


# Assignment #2:

Write a script to print out `one` multiplication table for a `number`
`specified` by the current user

Example:
```
What multiplication table do you like to see? 3
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 4 = 12
3 * 5 = 15
3 * 6 = 18
3 * 7 = 21
3 * 8 = 24
3 * 9 = 27
3 * 10 = 30
```

# Assignment #3:

Write a script to print out the multiplication tables from 1 to 10

# Assignment #4:

- Write a script to ask the current user for a `number` between `20` and `100`.
- Count `upto` that number. However...
- If the current number is `divisible` by 3, print `"Fizz"` instead
- If the current number is `divisible` by 5, print `"Buzz"` instead
- If the current number is `divisible` by 15, print `"FizzBuzz"` instead
- To test if number x is divisible by y, use (x % y == 0) as the condition
