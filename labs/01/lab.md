# Instruction

- To do the labs, you need to be able to get user's input. Python provides `input()` to do exactly that:
  ```
  >>> input()
  x
  'x'
  >>> input("This is a prompt")
  This is a promptAAAAA
  'AAAAA'
  >>> n = input("Give me some input: ")
  Give me some input: This is the input
  >>> n
  'This is the input'
  ```

- You also need a way to write to the console. Python provides `print()` to do exactly that:
  ```
  >>> print("Someething")
  Someething
  >>> x = 10
  >>> print(x)
  10
  >>> print(x, "+ 5 =", x + 5)
  10 + 5 = 15
  ```
